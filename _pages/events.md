## Current Events

IFIP WG11.6's main activity is the organisation of the annual [IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management](https://ifip-summerschool.org/), which takes place annually and has been co-organised by IFIP 11.6 in cooperation with WG 9.2 and WG 9.6/11.7. The IFIP Summer Schools have become a well established event for PhD students and senior researchers with 50-90 participants. Its 3-round review process is especially appreciated by younger PhD students as an aid for fulfilling the scientific quality standards for getting their papers published at the Springer Summer School proceedings.

## Past Events

In the past, WG 11.6 also arranged the IFIP 11.6's IDMAN as a series of IFIP working conferences focusing on the theory, technology and applications of identity management that takes place every third year. However, due to higher pressure in the research community to present and publish only at high-ranked conference, we see challenges in arranging another IDMAN conference at the moment and are thus focussing on the summer schools.

The following three conferences have been organized:
* [IFIP IDMAN 2007](https://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/idman/idman2007/index.html), Rotterdam, The Netherlands
* [IFIP IDMAN 2010](https://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/idman/idman2010/index.html), Oslo, Norway
* [IFIP IDMAN 2013](http://www.idman2013.com/)), London, UK
